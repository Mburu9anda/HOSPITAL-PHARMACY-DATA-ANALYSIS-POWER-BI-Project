# HOSPITAL-PHARMACY-DATA-ANALYSIS-POWER-BI-Project
## Executive Summary
 
This project analyzes hospital and pharmacy data using Power BI to uncover actionable insights on patient visits, disease patterns, and pharmacy financial performance. By cleaning and modeling messy multi-departmental data, the dashboard provides management with a clear view of cost drivers, revenue behavior, treatment trends, and operational efficiency. The insights support data-driven decision-making in resource allocation, procurement planning, and patient care optimization.

## Key Insights - Hospital & Pharmacy Data Analysis

### Patient & Disease Trends

A small group of diagnoses accounts for the majority of hospital visits across counties, indicating recurring public health patterns. Disease prevalence varies by county, suggesting geographic differences in environmental, lifestyle, or healthcare access factors. Typhoid lead where it was prevalent in all the counties at a big rate.

### Pharmacy Revenue vs Patient Visits

Higher patient visits do not always translate to proportionally higher pharmacy revenue. In a county like Kiambu, it had high patient visist but the revenue wasn`t high as compared to their counterparts , Uasin Gishu.  Revenue performance is influenced more by drug category mix and treatment intensity than visit volume alone.

### Department Cost Drivers

Inpatient contributed the most cake of revenue collection mainly because it had a higher pharmacy spending as compared to outpatient and emergency. Cost concentration suggests opportunities for procurement optimization and inventory control.

### Age Group Medication Consumption

The elderly had the largest drug consumption highlighting the importance of targeted pharmaceutical planning and showcasing that they consume significantly more medication particularly due to their chronic conditions that come with age.

### Length of Stay vs Pharmacy Spending

Some diagnoses are associated with longer hospital stays but relatively moderate pharmacy spending, indicating care complexity beyond medication costs. Some diagnoses like the flu on the other hand have long hospital stays but low pharmacy spending and we can attribute this to low cost of the flu medications. Other cases like Malaria show shorter stays with high drug costs, often linked to intensive treatments. This insight supports better cost allocation and treatment efficiency analysis.
